# js_gameoflife
JS Game of Life Implementation to experiment with Cloud9's features and to see if it's a viable IDE for me. 

# Ideas for the Project
* Use Paper.js for drawing the simulation canvas
* Howler.js for possible sound-effects
* Built-in library of patterns
* Possibility to easily try different rule-sets for the simulation
* Experimenting with simulation grids using other tesselated polygons. Triangles, pentagons, etc.
* Possibility for multiple users to access the same grid interactively
